## Personal Reflection

One thing I‚Äôve noticed throughout this journey is how often I underestimated myself before starting a problem. Whenever I came across a task that seemed too difficult or lengthy, I would feel like I wouldn‚Äôt be able to solve it. But instead of putting it off for the next day, I made it a point to tackle it head-on‚Äîor take a short break and return with a fresh mind.

Surprisingly, once I started working on those ‚Äúscary‚Äù problems, they became manageable, and sometimes even fun. What felt like too much often turned out to be completely doable once I just got started. This habit of pushing through tough-looking problems has helped me grow not just as a programmer but also in terms of discipline and confidence.

The key lesson: **Start. Then keep going. The rest unfolds.**
Happy coding! üöÄ
